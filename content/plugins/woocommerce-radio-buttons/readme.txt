Light-weight plugin that converts your Woocommerce variations in to radio buttons.

This is a compatible version of Woo Radio Buttons for Woocommerce 2.0 and above.  For earlier versions please visit designloud.com.  This is a simple and light-weight plugin that once installed and activated will convert your Woocommerce variations from a drop down menu to radio buttons.  Allow your consumers to see all of your variations without having to access your drop down menu.(Optional) Make sure you are using variations for your product(s) and set a default variation to be selected in your edit product page to automatically display the add to cart button.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `woo-radio-buttons-2.0` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. (Optional) Make sure you are using variations for your product(s) and set a default variation to be selected in your edit product page to automatically display the add to cart button.

== Frequently asked questions ==
= How to display 'add to cart' and selected variation automatically =
Open your WP Dashboard and click on products, then click on one of your variation products and scroll down to product data.  Under the tab 'variations' select a default variation (towards the bottom) and click update :).

= I just updated your plugin and my radio buttons do not work anymore =
Make sure that you have updated to the latest version of Woocommerce and mapped your product data as their notification suggests.

= I have downloaded your plugin and activated but I still do not get any radio buttons =
This is typically caused by a theme or plugin conflicting.  Try activating the default twenty-twelve wordpress theme.  If that doesnt work then go through and deactivate your plugins and then reactivate one at a time to find the conflict.
