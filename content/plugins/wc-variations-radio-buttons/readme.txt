Variations Radio Buttons for WooCommerce. Let your customers choose product variations using radio buttons instead of dropdowns.

== Description ==

Radio buttons are more friendly than dropdown selects. This plugin will help you have a better UX in your WooCommerce site, as your customers will see all your variations without having to click on a dropdown.

The radio buttons will be toggled dinamically so your customers won't be able to choose non existent variations.

### Theme Compatibility

This plugin may not work out of the box with some themes. This is due to a theme having its own template for variation selection (single-product/add-to-cart/variable.php).

To make this plugin work with a non compatible theme, a [child theme](http://themify.me/docs/child-themes) has to be created.
Then copy plugins/wc-variations-radio-buttons/templates/single-product/add-to-cart/variable.php to themes/your-child-theme/woocommerce/single-product/add-to-cart/variable.php
